# Fundamentals of Practical Haskell Programming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Fundamentals of Practical Haskell Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/fundamentals-practical-haskell-programming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787288768), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Haskell is a powerful and well-designed functional programming language designed to work with complex data. Its emphasis on "purity" makes it easier to create rock-solid applications which stay maintainable and error-free even as they grow in scale.

This video course will take you through all the concepts of functional programming (FP) and Haskell language. First we’ll address all the problems with FP and Haskell. Then we’ll help you distinguish the difference between FP and Haskell. We’ll then guide you through Haskell in depth. We’ll help you create your first Haskell program. You’ll then be given a brief insight into GHCi (Glasgow Haskell Compiler). Later we’ll explore the different values, expressions and programs in Haskell in depth.

By the end of this course you’ll have a foundation set-up to start writing your own Haskell programs and also have ample knowledge of the important functionalities of Haskell.
